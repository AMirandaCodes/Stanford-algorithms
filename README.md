# Stanford Algorithms – Programming Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the programming exercises from the course **_Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1_** by Stanford University, taken via edX.
The goal of this repository is to practice implementing core algorithmic ideas while building a clear, well-documented reference of my progress through the course.

I chose **Python** as the programming language for these assignments.

## Course Overview

This course emphasises:
- Conceptual understanding over low-level implementation details
- Algorithmic thinking and performance analysis
- Practical problem-solving using well-known algorithmic techniques

This course aims to help learners to gain a strong foundation in algorithm design and analysis.

## Topics Covered

**Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1** includes:

- Asymptotic analysis (Big-O notation)
- Sorting and searching
- Divide and conquer algorithms
- The Master Method
- Randomized algorithms (e.g. QuickSort, Min-Cut)
- Data structures:
  - Heaps
  - Balanced binary search trees
  - Hash tables
  - Bloom filters
- Graph algorithms:
  - BFS and DFS
  - Connectivity
  - Shortest paths (Dijkstra’s algorithm)

## Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a **programming assignment or topic** from the course and includes:
- A brief explanation of the problem
- My approach to solving it
- The implementation code

### Notes
- Solutions are written for learning purposes.
- Code prioritizes readability and conceptual clarity.
- This repository reflects my progression through the course over time.
